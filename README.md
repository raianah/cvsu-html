### What is This?
- This is my final project in Intro to Computing. Mainly written in HTML/CSS/JavaScript, this provides additional info through code documentation, or via this file.

### Anything you like to say here?

# Start:
- ## Main Page
    - What you can see here:
        - Our Title: RC's Review Blog is the name of our title, with a cool-looking logo.
        - Discover Something: This is a sub-type of blog/article that redirects you to an external link, link that isn't ours. This is to provide more blogs/articles on some blog-worthy sites.
        - Our Review Blog: You can see our very own review blogs in the middle of the webpage. There are only 2 review blogs.
        - Our Goal: We also put our disclaimer on our review blogs for the users to understand what really our goal is.
            - Our goal is to not critically criticize any forms of culture, food, items. We do this for educational purposes only. We are not official critiques.
        - Footer: Giving some credits to the creator, the contributor, and the repository/source code on Github.
- ### First Review Blog:
    - What you can see here:
        - Logo: You can only see the logo itself. Nothing.
        - Blog Image Header: You can also see this header on our main page.
        - Title and no. of mins: You can also see the number of minutes needed to read the entire blog, the creator, and the date published.
        - Content: Blog can't be blog without content.
        - Scroll Bar: You can see your current progress while reading, to let you know how long is the blog. You can see this above of your webpage, and this isn't visible until you scroll down.
        - Footer: Giving some credits to the creator, the contributor, and the repository/source code on Github.
- ### Second Review Blog:
    - What you can see here:
        - The same as first review blog, but with more images and longer read.
