    /* Progress bar are indeed a complex type of code, but it's worth it to discuss and implement especially if your website focuses on blogs or articles.
       A tiny little progress bar makes your website look nice, and also provides additional information on the user side's reading progress.
       
       .header class - Where should the progress bar be. Fixed position will make the progress bar stay in your screen even scrolled down.
            z-index sets the z-order of a positioned element and its descendants or flex items. AKA overlapping current image elements.
       .progress class - We just define the width, height, and the background color of the said bar.
       .bar class - We define the content (liquid) of the progress bar. How should it look when filled up.
       .bar-content class - The starting point of the progress bar. padding value makes the output fair and square. If left is provided, same goes to right. If up is provided,
            same goes as down. */

    <h2>hristmas according to Wikipedia, is an annual festival <br> commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ that is observed <br>
        primarily on December 25 as a religious and cultural <br> celebration among billions of people around the world. <br>
        <br> Christmas can be also a season of thanksgiving (for those <br> who don't have thanksgiving day) and family
        bondings, <br> creating happy memories with the family during winter.<br><br>
        As time goes by, with the booming of gadgets and <br> technology in general, Christmas seems to have lost<br> its true meaning.
        And all we have is Christmas without<br>your loved ones, especially during this pandemic.<br><br>
        Christmas in the early 2000s has been a great memories for <br> us, when we are kids. But as time goes by, the season of<br>
        Christmas seems to fade away. And with that here are the <br> 5 reasons why Christmas will never be the same as 2012.<br><br>
        1) Responsibilities: As we grow up, our responsibility is <br> increasing. And probably as a functional working adult, <br>
        you rather have to take a rest than spending time with your <br> loved ones.<br><br> When we are kids (or toddlers), we don't
        think of electricity<br>/water/house bills, and all we have to do is to be play and <br> especially, be happy. Well as an adult,
        we don't do that here.<br><br>2) Being Busy: Having a lot of responsibility is there, and it <br> requires work. And with work, comes
        exhaustion. If we are <br> exhausted, we tend to rest all day, instead of going out and do <br> something. Trust me, you can't even play games
        and you might <br> want to spend your free time sleeping, or exercising.<br><br>3) Rise of Technology: Lastly, this factor affects people of
        all <br> ages. With technology lying around, people tend to just surf <br> on the internet all day instead of physically communicating <br>
        with someone somewhere. <br><br> Children are heavily affected by the technology, because <br> instead of playing with the people around them,
        they just play <br> with their gadgets all day. It does affect both physically and <br> mentally as they venture in the world of internet.<br><br>
        But no matter the reason, Christmas wasn't made yesterday. <br> The spirit of Christmas will live forever even the people will <br> change.<br><br>

    All of these progress bar classes, will go down on this one. This is the reason why it is called progress bar.
    This is written in JavaScript, my most hated language.

    using module window, we are using the window property "onscroll" for later purposes.
    we declare a function(), and we add a new function name

    <script> element is useful for adding dynamic texts and sprinkle of JavaScript in their HTML code.

    we use again the function with the function name followed by curly brackets.
    and we define the variables (var)
        var progress_scroll = we are checking if it is scrolled by a <body> element or by <html> element.
                          || represents "LOGICAL OR", the same in Python as simply "or"
                          (eg comparison:
                            JavaScript: if a || b:
                            Python: if a or b:)
        var height = we are subtracting the entire height value of the class "content" without padding given above by the height value with padding
        var prog_scrolled = we are dividing the value of progress_scroll and height, then multiplied by 100
        then we get the element by id "pbar" provided above, and we customize the width by the value of prog_scrolled in percentage
-->
<script>
    window.onscroll = function() {progress_func()};

    function progress_func() {
        var progress_scroll = document.body.scrollTop || document.documentElement.scrollTop;
        var height = document.documentElement.scrollHeight - document.documentElement.clientHeight;
        var prog_scrolled = (progress_scroll / height) * 100;
        document.getElementById("pbar").style.width = prog_scrolled + "%";
    }
</script>

<!--
    When you pressed "Back on Top", it automatically makes your webpage to go to the topmost part. This code is responsible for it.

    Given the #rectangle in the class section, we just made a minimal-looking fancy button instead of the built-in button.
    onclick - The reaction of the rectangle when clicked.
        using the module document, we define our topmost part of the webpage.
        scrollTop gives you live statistics of number of pixels while scrolling. At this point we gave it a value 0, so it is now immutable.
            (immutable means cannot be changed)
        since document.body represents <body> element while documentElement.scrollTop represents <html> element, we are making sure that all of them returns to it's value
        to prevent unnecessary errors

    These onclick values can be used in <img> element, and texts.
