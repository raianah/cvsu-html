    /* TAKE NOTE BEFORE CLONING IT:
       This webpage was written in Microsoft Edge (Version 97).
       It might look distorted in your selected browser. To manually change the webpage resolution,
       change the value of height, margin, width to your current resolution, or change the value of background-size to your browser resolution. 
       
       Current System:
          - Microsoft Edge (Version 97)
          - 1290 x 658 browser resolution

       To run this in your system clone it on GitHub, and/or download the following fonts, if not provided by the clone itself:
          - Glacial Indifference (Bold and Regular) [ Free for Commercial Use ]
          - Quicksand (Regular) [ Free for Commercial Use ]
          - DM Serif Display (Regular) [ Free for Personal Use ]
       (Normally those fonts are automatically downloaded when cloned to GitHub)
       
       To clone this on your system do this:
          - Download Git from here: https://git-scm.com/downloads (If you don't have one)
          - Follow the process from there. Here is guide if you are stuck: https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-git-windows
          - Commit `git clone <github link>`, copy the link on where you first found this repository. It should be in this following format: https://github.com/raianah/my_repository
          - Open the two files named project1.html, and project2.html separately.
          - In the URL query copy the given link and paste it on the following:
             - project1.html belongs to the <div class="firstimage"> and <div class="headline"> under href method.
             - project2.html belongs to the <div class="secondimage"> and <div class="headline-2> under href method
             - Don't forget to save those changes and open project.html (main file).
             - Everything should work from there. If not, kindly open an issue and directly point to the problem. */

    /* Welcome to my ~~Yandere Source Code~~ Basic HTML. This is for direct documentation only. Kindly use README.md file if you're not familiar with this. 
    
    HTML - This is to customize the Overall height & width representation, and designation of scroll to make the web page scrollable.
         - The background color is set to newspaper color theme. This is to make everything the same as the given background color which is in the same color.
           When you scroll down it should appear as long image.
         - overflow-x is for making the webpage scrollable horizontally. Since we don't need this, it is set to hidden.
         - overflow-y is for making the webpage scrollable vertically. Since we are not using the classy <p>, we need to customize this to make it scrollable.
            
    Unlike Python, every HTML line should end in semi-colon. If the ending is a curly bracket no need to put semi-colon. */

            - background-size is to resize the following image (the original image is set to 1366 x 768, which appears big in the browser.
            - background-repeat is to tell the webpage that if it reaches the bottomline of the image, it will produce another set of image causing it to repeat.
            - position is to tell the image if how does the image behave.
                - static value is just...there. Anything you changed does not affect the background.
                - relative value is according to the normal flow of the document. This is useful for not creating a mess when relocating the said image to x & y values.
                - absolute value can overlap current elements existed. AKA overlapping.
                - fixed value does stay on your screen, even if you scroll down or up. */

    different inputs inside div element:
       - h1-h6: header type. I don't use paragraphs simply to enlarge texts. Using <p> is unnecessary in this webpage since everything is header.
       - anchor: anchor element can be used for several reasons:
           - adding css styling to a text/image.
              - text-decoration refers to additional decorations to a font. This is useful if you don't want underlined text in an hyperlinked text.
              - color sets to a text on how will it be. This overlaps the given color in your class. This is useful if you don't want to make your text reacts to href.
           - adding hyperlinks to a text/image.
              - specifying how would the hyperlink behave when clicked
                 - _self value reloads the current browser to the link provided in the href value.
                 - _blank value opens another tab to the link provided.
                 - _parent value opens to the parent browsing. If not provided, it acts just like _self.
                 - _top opens to the top-level browsing context. If not provided, it acts just like _self.
